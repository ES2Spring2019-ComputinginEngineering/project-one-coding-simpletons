# Project Title

Our group simulated pendulum angular position, angular velocity, and angular acceleration data for 5 different pendulum lengths assuming the use of a simple pendulum. Later, using a microbit on the end of a lego piece pendulum, we recorded the varying acceleration of the microbit for 5 seconds and generated data about its angular position over that time interval for 5 different pendulum lengths each with 5 different trials. 

From both the simulated and real data, we obtained oscillation period values which we compared directly and then also using a log relationship. 

## Instructions

- Main: (Spyder) This is the key component of our program. Running this file produces all the graphs: simulated data, real data, and period vs. length. 

- Pendulum: (Spyder) Includes important functions related to the data including: calculating the angle from acceleration values, plotting the real data, and averaging the period for each pendulum length (avg. of the 5 trials). 

- Simulation: (Spyder) Includes 1 function which plots the simulated data for a given pendulum length and calculates the peirod. 

- data collection: (Mu.editor) Records data from the microbit and generates a file with acceleration and time values.
